Portfolio Website — Built as Part of Figma & Front-End Learning Program

- This project followed a guided course curriculum where I practiced implementing a design brief from a tutor. While the visual style was provided, I focused on responsive layout, HTML/CSS, and building a live site from a Figma file.
- In hindsight, I’d redesign the visuals to better reflect my style — but this version shows my ability to follow structure, build to spec, and deploy a live result.
